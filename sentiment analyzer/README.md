# Sentiment Analyzer 

## Overview

I present here a simply text classification Flask app which classifies sentiment of customerâ€™s review on Customer Review Tab whether it is positive or negative which, the trained model predicts. I have trained the model in sci-kit learn (machine learning). An analysis of the submitted reviews can be found under the Review Analysis Tab which is a useful tab for business owners to see analysis of their business performance.
The app can be accessible at : https://sentiment-analyzer-ml.herokuapp.com/home
